                <h3>Quotes for Tough Workouts</h3>
                <p>When it comes to working out, you have to find some kind of schedule that works for you. For me, I
                    either have to get up at 5 a.m. and work out before work or force myself to work out when I get
                    home. The latter is difficult, because by the time I get home from work, I want to put on pajamas,
                    not tennis shoes. If this sounds like you, workout motivation quotes can help.</p>
